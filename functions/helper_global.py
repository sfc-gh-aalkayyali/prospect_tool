Hi [Name],


I noticed Telstra's efforts to expand in-house gen AI solutions to improve customer interactions, including "One Sentence Summary" and "Ask Telstra". Leveraging data and AI for customer understanding and personalisation is clearly a top strategic priority for you. 


I'm part of the account team at Snowflake which supports Telstra. Given your role, I thought you might be interested in the work we're doing at Spark NZ, using AI to hyper-personalise experiences on the data cloud, increasing marketing message conversions by 20x and reducing marketing spend by 16%. 


If this sounds interesting, would it be a terrible use of time to explore how we might do the same for Telstra?

Hey [Name],


Your role in Performance and Strategy and previous experience in energy prompted me to reach out. Are you involved with ESG initiatives at Telstra? 


The reason I ask is because Snowflake has a data marketplace with dozens of ESG datasets maintained by other companies. You can get access and report on these in real-time. This could help you to cut costs and hit your ESG and energy consumption targets. 


Telstra Health have recently onboarded Snowflake and we're having conversations across the larger Telstra organisation. It would be great to introduce you to the Snowflake account team who can provide a tailored discussion and explain what we're doing with similar businesses to help with their ESG targets.

Hi [Name],


I noticed your role as Senior Cybersecurity Architect at Telstra and it prompted me to reach out. 


By way of introduction, I support the Telstra team here at Snowflake. Given your role as Senior Cybersecurity Architect, I thought you might be interested in how Snowflake integrates with Splunk, providing more than 50% cost savings.


We hear cybersecurity teams using Splunk often face similar challenges related to cost, scalability and usability.


Snowflake leverages our platform for security analytics to reduce SIEM costs while enabling more proactive risk management, simplifying compliance, and detecting sophisticated threats.


The best part is that you can retain Splunk and use Snowflake as a security lake only. Cost savings can be up to 90%, eliminating data egress costs and providing you faster access to your data.


If the time permits, Iâ€™d love to schedule 30 minutes in the calendar to discuss how we could replicate this at Telstra. How is your availability next Wednesday?
