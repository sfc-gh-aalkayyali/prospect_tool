Subject: How Telstra Can Achieve 20x Marketing Conversions with AI

Hi [Name],

I noticed Telstra's efforts to expand in-house gen AI solutions to improve customer interactions, including "One Sentence Summary" and "Ask Telstra". Leveraging data and AI for customer understanding and personalisation is clearly a top strategic priority for you. 

I'm part of the account team at Snowflake which supports Telstra. Given your role, I thought you might be interested in the work we're doing at Spark NZ, using AI to hyper-personalise experiences on the data cloud, increasing marketing message conversions by 20x and reducing marketing spend by 16%. 

If this sounds interesting, would it be a terrible use of time to explore how we might do the same for Telstra? 

How is your availability on Wednesday at 3pm or 4pm for a 20/30 minute intro on Teams?

Cheers,
